# Neural Style Transfer

**This program is a rip-off of *NEURAL STYLE TRANSFER* algorithm implemented in programming exercise of coursera's Deep Learning Specialization**

1) The program takes two images namely *Content image* and *Style image* as input.

2) Program uses vgg16 network to Generate mixed image.
